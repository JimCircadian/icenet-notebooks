## IceNet Notebooks

This folder contains instructional notebooks that describe how to use the library and pipelining utilities built around it. 

The notebooks 01-05 are intended for instruction and contain output from example runs.

Notebooks xx.\* are illustrative and exemplify/contain runs from the operational infrastructure, but rely on the model run(s) they were run against. These are easily adaptable for your own local executions with IceNet.
