## icenet-notebooks

This repository contains instructional notebooks that describe how to use the library and pipelining utilities built around it. 

The notebooks 01-05 are intended for instruction and contain output from example runs.

Notebooks xx.\* are illustrative and exemplify/contain runs from the operational infrastructure, but rely on the model run(s) they were run against. These are easily adaptable for your own local executions with IceNet.

### scratch\_ noteboooks

Many of the other notebooks are scratch or potentially useful (or were once useful) when the codebase was being refactored. These are named scratch\_ to show that they're only potentially useful if you want to explore or adapt them.

### Other notebooks

Any other notebook is likely related to events or presentations that have been given.
