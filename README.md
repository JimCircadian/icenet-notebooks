## icenet-notebooks

This repository contains instructional notebooks that describe how to use the library and pipelining utilities built around it. 

### Instructional notebooks

_Currently only notebooks 01 and 02 are completely tested_

The notebooks 01-05 are intended for instruction and contain output from example runs.

Notebooks xx.\* are illustrative and exemplify/contain runs from the operational infrastructure, but rely on the model run(s) they were run against. These are easily adaptable for your own local executions with IceNet.

#### Status / Compatibility

__These are compatible at time of writing with the 0.2.\* version of the [IceNet library](https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet).__

### scratch\_ noteboooks

Many of the other notebooks are scratch or potentially useful (or were once useful) when the codebase was being refactored. These are named scratch\_ to show that they're only potentially useful if you want to explore or adapt them.

### Other notebooks

Any other notebook is likely related to events or presentations that have been given.
